359. Logger Rate Limiter

Design a logger system that receives a stream of messages along with their timestamps. Each unique message should only be printed at most every 10 seconds (i.e. a message printed at timestamp t will prevent other identical messages from being printed until timestamp t + 10).

All messages will come in chronological order. Several messages may arrive at the same timestamp.

Implement the Logger class:

Logger() Initializes the logger object.
bool shouldPrintMessage(int timestamp, string message) Returns true if the message should be printed in the given timestamp, otherwise returns false.
 

Example 1:

Input
["Logger", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage"]
[[], [1, "foo"], [2, "bar"], [3, "foo"], [8, "bar"], [10, "foo"], [11, "foo"]]
Output
[null, true, true, false, false, false, true]

Explanation
Logger logger = new Logger();
logger.shouldPrintMessage(1, "foo");  // return true, next allowed timestamp for "foo" is 1 + 10 = 11
logger.shouldPrintMessage(2, "bar");  // return true, next allowed timestamp for "bar" is 2 + 10 = 12
logger.shouldPrintMessage(3, "foo");  // 3 < 11, return false
logger.shouldPrintMessage(8, "bar");  // 8 < 12, return false
logger.shouldPrintMessage(10, "foo"); // 10 < 11, return false
logger.shouldPrintMessage(11, "foo"); // 11 >= 11, return true, next allowed timestamp for "foo" is
                                      // 11 + 10 = 21
 

Constraints:

0 <= timestamp <= 109
Every timestamp will be passed in non-decreasing order (chronological order).
1 <= message.length <= 30
At most 104 calls will be made to shouldPrintMessage.

## Notes

This was an easy one. I did it to keep a good streak of doing things everyday. Hopefully I'm going to run out so I should get more serious and up my game when I have time.

Did this at the end of the night. Tripped up on a bunch of syntax things but I feel like the solution was ok.

First submission was accepted. Performance was 98.8% percentile but memory was 5.10%, I think its because the map that holds all of the log information gets really large. Off the top of my head I feel like there's so many things that can be done to help with that: pruning, hashing th log message which can be anywhere from 0 to 30 chars...

I think that the time complexity is O(n) since every single log message will be parsed, and that the space complexity will also be O(n)... I think.
